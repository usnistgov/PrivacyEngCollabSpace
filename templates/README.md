## More Information about the Use Case Template

A “use case” is an example of an organization processing data about individuals for some explicit purpose(s) (e.g., where a goal is to prevent re-identification of the data during its processing, improve privacy risk management practices).

These use case template can be used for scenarios where solutions have been implemented or where solutions are needed.
