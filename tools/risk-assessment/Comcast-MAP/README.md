# Comcast xCompass 

**Name of Tool:** xCOMPASS Questionnaire

**Primary Focus Area:** Privacy Threat Modeling

**Brief Description:** xCOMPASS is a questionnaire developed from Models of Applied Privacy (MAP) personas so that threat modelers can ask specific and targeted questions covering a range of privacy threats. Each question is linked to a persona, built on top of LINDDUN and NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology. xCompass contextualizes threats, by considering potential privacy threats as a combination of threat actor (both malicious and benign), mechanism of attack, and probable impact. Teams can use xCOMPASS directly as an assessment to model different privacy threats to their application. For more information on xCOMPASS, please use the link below.
